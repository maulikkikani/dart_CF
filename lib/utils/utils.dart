    "As Captain America, Steve Rogers carries a nearly indestructible shield fashioned from the rare Wakandan metal known as vibranium. Designed and crafted by genius inventor Howard Stark during World War II, the shield is a perfectly balanced instrument capable of withstanding intense stress and damage, yet also able to be thrown as an offensive weapon that rebounds back to its owner. Rogers maintains the shield as an almost constant companion after it was recovered from the wreckage of the Red Skull’s airplane, as it has become a symbol of strength to all those who recognize Captain America as the country’s defender."

    "For his first post-jail break-in, Lang chose the home of reclusive scientist Hank Pym, but once inside Pym’s vault, all he found was a strange suit and accompanying helmet. Thinking it might still be worth something, he took the equipment home and quickly discovered the extent of Pym’s work. The suit enabled him to shrink to ant size, and though Pym himself—who had intentionally led Lang to the suit—tried to talk Lang through the experience by way of the helmet, the engineer had enough and attempted to return the gear to its rightful owner.

    "Seeking to address the dearth of Black characters in comics, Lee and Kirby created T’Challa, a member of the royal family of the fictional African country of Wakanda. Wakanda was depicted as a peculiar mix of futuristic technology and traditional life, a dichotomy produced by the presence in the country of Vibranium, a rare and nearly indestructible meteoric ore. After the death of his father at the hands of the villainous Ulysses Klaw, T’Challa claimed the throne as well as the mantle of the Black Panther. Upon becoming the Black Panther, T’Challa was exposed to a mystical herb that enhanced his strength and agility to near-superhuman levels."
